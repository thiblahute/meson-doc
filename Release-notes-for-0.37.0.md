**0.37.0 is not released yet, these are preliminary**

# New features

## Mesontest

Mesontest is a new testing tool that allows you to run your tests in many different ways. As an example you can run tests multiple times:

    mesontest --repeat=1000 a_test

or with an arbitrary wrapper executable:

    mesontest --wrap='valgrind --tool=helgrind' a_test

or under gdb, 1000 times in a row. This is handy for tests that fail spuriously, as when the crash happens you are given the full GDB command line:

    mesontest --repeat=1000 --gdb a_test

## Mesonrewriter

Mesonrewrite is an experimental tool to manipulate your build definitions programmatically. It is not installed by default yet but those interested can run it from the source repository.

As an example, here is how you would add a source file to a build target:

    mesonrewriter add --target=program --filename=new_source.c

One of the major problems of multiplatform development is wrangling all your dependencies. This is easy on Linux where you can use system packages but awkward on other platforms. Most of those do not have a package manager at all. This has been worked around by having third party package managers. They are not really a solution for end user deployment, because you can't tell them to install a package manager just to use your app. On these platforms you must produce self-contained applications.

The traditional approach to this has been to bundle dependencies inside your own project. Either as prebuilt libraries and headers or by embedding the source code inside your source tree and rewriting your build system to build them as part of your project.

This is both tedious and error prone because it is always done by hand. The Wrap dependency system of Meson aims to provide an automated way to do this.

## How it works

Meson has a concept of [subprojects](Subprojects). They are a way of nesting one Meson project inside another. Any project that builds with Meson can detect that it is built as a subproject and build itself in a way that makes it easy to use (usually this means as a static library).

To use this kind of a project as a dependency you could just copy and extract it inside your project's <tt>subprojects</tt> directory. However there is a simpler way. You can specify a Wrap file that tells Meson how to download it for you. An example wrap file would look like this:

    [mesonwrap]
    directory = libfoobar-1.0

    source_url = http://example.com/foobar-1.0.tar.gz
    source_filename = foobar-1.0.tar.gz
    source_hash = 5ebeea0dfb75d090ea0e7ff84799b2a7a1550db3fe61eb5f6f61c2e971e57663

If you then use this subproject in your build, Meson will automatically download and extract it during build. This makes subproject embedding extremely easy.

Unfortunately most software projects in the world do not build with Meson. Because of this Meson allows you to specify a patch url. This works in much the same way as Debian's distro patches. That is, they are downloaded and automatically applied to the subproject. These files contain a Meson build definition for the given subproject. A wrap file with an additional patch url would look like this.

    [mesonwrap]
    directory = libfoobar-1.0

    source_url = http://upstream.example.com/foobar-1.0.tar.gz
    source_filename = foobar-1.0.tar.gz
    source_hash = 5ebeea0dfb75d090ea0e7ff84799b2a7a1550db3fe61eb5f6f61c2e971e57663

    patch_url = https://myserver.example.com/libfoobar-meson.tar.gz
    patch_filename = libfoobar-meson.tar.gz
    patch_hash = 8c9d00702d5fe4a6bf25a36b821a332f6b2dfd117c66fe818b88b23d604635e9

In this example the Wrap manager would download the patch and unzip it in libfoobar's directory.

This approach makes it extremely simple to embed dependencies that require build system changes. You can write the Meson build definition for the dependency in total isolation. This is a lot better than doing it inside your own source tree, especially if it contains hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Once you have a working build definition, just zip up the Meson build files (and others you have changed) and put them somewhere where you can download them.

## Using wrapped projects

To use a subproject simply do this in your top level <tt>meson.build</tt>.

    foobar_sp = subproject('foobar')

Usually dependencies consist of some header files plus a library to link against. To do this you would store the include_directories and library in your subproject's <tt>meson.build</tt> like this:

    foobar_incs = include_directories(...)
    foobar_lib = static_library(...)

Then in your main project you would use them like this:

    executable('toplevel_exe', 'prog.c',
      include_directories : foobar_sp.get_variable('foobar_incs'),
      link_with : foobar_sp.get_variable('foobar_lib'))

## Toggling between distro packages and embedded source

When building distro packages it is very important that you do not embed any sources. Some distros have a rule forbidding embedded dependencies so your project must be buildable without them or otherwise the packager will hate you.

Doing this with Meson and Wrap is simple. Here's how you would use distro packages and fall back to embedding if the dependency is not available.

    foobar_dep = dependency('foobar', required : false)

    if foobar_dep.found()
      foobar_inc = []
      foobar_lib = []
    else
      foobar_sp = subproject('foobar')
      foobar_inc = foobar_sp.get_variable('foobar_inc')
      foobar_lib = foobar_sp.get_variable('foobar_lib')
    endif

    executable('toplevel_exe', 'prog.c',
      include_directories : foobar_inc,
      link_with : foobar_lib,
      dependencies : foobar_dep)

Note that whether foobar is found or not, the keyword arguments to <tt>toplevel_exe</tt> are correct. Either <tt>foobar_inc</tt> and <tt>foobar_lib</tt> are defined and <tt>foobar_dep</tt> is empty or vice versa.

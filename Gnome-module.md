This module provides helper tools for build operations needed when building Gnome/GLib programs.

## compile_resources

This function compiles resources specified in an XML file into code that can be embedded inside the main binary. Similar a build target it takes two positional arguments. The first one is the name of the resource and the second is the xml file containing the resource definitions. If the name is <tt>foobar</tt> then Meson will generate a header file called <tt>foobar.h</tt>, which you can then include in your sources. There are two keyword arguments.

* <tt>source_dir</tt>: a subdirectory where the resource compiler should look up the files, relative to the location of the xml file
* <tt>c_name</tt>: passed to the resource compiler as an argument after <tt>--c-name</tt>

Returns an opaque object that you should pass into your build target.

## generate_gir

Generates GObject introspection data. Takes one positional argument, the build target you want to build gir data for. There are several keyword arguments.

* <tt>sources</tt> the list of sources to be scanned for gir data
* <tt>nsversion</tt> namespace version
* <tt>namespace</tt> the namespace for this gir object
* <tt>install</tt> if true, install the generated gir file
* <tt>install_dir</tt> which subdirectory to install the gir file into

This function returns nothing.

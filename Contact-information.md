For general discussion and questions, it is strongly recommended that you use the [mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/p/meson/mailman/).

If you find bugs, please file them in the [issue tracker](https://sourceforge.net/p/meson/tickets/).

The maintainer of Meson is Jussi Pakkanen. You should usually not contact him privately but rather use the channels listed above. However if such a need arises, he can be reached at gmail where his username is <tt>jpakkane</tt> (that is not a typo, the last letter is indeed *e*).

# Trunk

Meson operates under the principle that trunk should (in theory) be always good enough for release. That is, all code merged in trunk must pass all unit tests. Any broken code should either be fixed or reverted immediately.

People who are willing to tolerate the occasional glitch should be able to use Meson trunk for their day to day development if they so choose.

# Major releases

Major releases are currently in the form 0.X.0, where X is an increasing number. We aim to do a major release roughly once a month, though the schedule is not set in stone. Prior to the release there is a stabilisation period of roughly a week. Major changes should not be committed during this time, but instead only small scale fixes.

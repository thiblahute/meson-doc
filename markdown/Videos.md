A good overview of Meson can be found in [this presentation from Linux.conf.au 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPi0AuVpxLI).

A talk describing the design goals behind Meson's multiplatform dependency system was held [the following year at LCA 2016](http://youtu.be/CTJtKtQ8R5k).

Libre Application Summit 2016 talk _New world, new tools_ explored further the [features and benefits of Meson's multiplatform support for building and dependencies](https://youtu.be/0-gx1qU2pPo).

The first ever public presentation on Meson was [this lightning talk](http://video.fosdem.org/2014/H2215_Ferrer/Sunday/Introducing_the_Meson_build_system.webm) at FOSDEM 2014.

Not all compilers and platforms are alike. Therefore Meson provides the tools to detect properties of the system during configure time. To get this information, you first need to extract the *compiler object* from the main *meson* variable.

    compiler = meson.get_compiler('c')

Here we extract the C compiler. We could also have given the argument <tt>cpp</tt> to get the C++ compiler, <tt>objc</tt> to get the objective C compiler and so on. The call is valid for all languages specified in the *project* declaration. Trying to obtain some other compiler will lead to an unrecoverable error.

Compiler id
==

The compiler object has a method called <tt>get_id</tt>, which returns a lower case string describing the "family" of the compiler. It has one of the following values.

Value | Compiler family
------|----------------
gcc | The GNU Compiler Collection
clang | The Clang compiler
msvc | Microsoft Visual Studio
intel | Intel compiler
pathscale | The Pathscale Fortran compiler
pgi | The Portland Fortran compiler
sun | Sun Fortran compiler
g95 | The G95 Fortran compiler
open64 | The Open64 Fortran Compiler
nagfor | The NAG Fortran compiler

Does code compile?
==

Sometimes the only way to test the system is to try to compile some sample code and see if it works. This is a two-phase operation. First we define some code using the multiline string operator:

    code = '''#include<stdio.h>
    void func() { printf("Compile me.\n"); }
    '''

Then we can run the test.

    result = compiler.compiles(code, name : 'basic check')

The variable *result* will now contain either <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> depending on whether the compilation succeeded or not. The keyword argument <tt>name</tt> is optional. If it is specified, Meson will write the result of the check to its log.

Compile and run test application
==

Here is how you would compile and run a small test application.

    code = '''#include<stdio.h>
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
      printf("%s\n", "stdout");
      fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", "stderr");
      return 0;
    }
    '''
    result = compiler.run(code, name : 'basic check')

The <tt>result</tt> variable encapsulates the state of the test, which can be extracted with the following methods. The <tt>name</tt> keyword argument works the same as with <tt>compiles</tt>.

Method | Return value
-------|----------------
compiled | <tt>True</tt> if compilation succeeded. If <tt>false</tt> then all other methods return undefined values.
returncode | The return code of the application as an integer
stdout | Program's standard out as text.
stderr | Program's standard error as text.

Here is an example usage:

    if result.stdout().strip() == 'some_value'
      # do something
    endif


Does a header exist?
==

Header files provided by different platforms vary quite a lot. Meson has functionality to detect whether a given header file is available on the system. The test is done by trying to compile a simple test program that includes the specified header. The following snippet describes how this feature can be used.

    if compiler.has_header('sys/fstat.h')
      # header exists, do something
    endif

Expression size
==

Often you need to determine the size of a particular element (such as <tt>int</tt>, <tt>wchar_t</tt> or <tt>char*</tt>). Using the <tt>compiler</tt> variable mentioned above, the check can be done like this.

    wcharsize = compiler.sizeof('wchar_t', prefix : '#include<wchar.h>')

This will put the size of <tt>wchar_t</tt> as reported by sizeof into variable <tt>wcharsize</tt>. The keyword argument <tt>prefix</tt> is optional. If specified its contents is put at the top of the source file. This argument is typically used for setting <tt>#include</tt> directives in configuration files.

Does a function exist?
==

Just having a header does say anything about its contents. Sometimes you need to explicitly check if some function exists. This is how we would check whether the function <tt>somefunc</tt> exists in header <tt>someheader.h</tt>

    if compiler.has_function('somefunc', prefix : '#include<someheader.h>')
      # function exists, do whatever is required.
    endif

Does a structure contain a member?
==

Some platforms have different standard structures. Here's how one would check if a struct called <tt>mystruct</tt> from header <tt>myheader.h</hh> contains a member called <tt>some_member</tt>.

    if compiler.has_member('struct mystruct', 'some_member', prefix : '#include<myheader.h>')
      # member exists, do whatever is required
    endif

Type alignment
==

Most platforms can't access some data types at any address. For example it is common that a <tt>char</tt> can be at any address but a 32 bit integer only at locations which are divisible by four. Determining the alignment of data types is simple.

    int_alignment = compiler.alignment('int') # Will most likely contain the value 4.
